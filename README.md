# GPS-IMU-time-cynclonization
This project demonstrates how to synchronize GPS (Global Positioning System) data with IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data in real-time to achieve highly accurate positioning and motion tracking. This system is designed for applications that require precise navigation, such as autonomous vehicles, UAVs, and robotics.
